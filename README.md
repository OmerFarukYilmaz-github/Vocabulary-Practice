# Vocabulary-Practice
It is a mobile project to practice English words.

We used Android Studio, SqlLite and Firebase translation API.

The project consists of two parts.

The first part is for practicing English words by level.

The second part is for translating unfamiliar words. After translation, that word can be added to my list.
